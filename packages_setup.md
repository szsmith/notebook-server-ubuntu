# XGBoost
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost
cd xgboost
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_CUDA=ON
make -j
```
Only set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to tell python where to find the library. For example, assume we cloned xgboost on the home directory ~. then we can added the following line in ~/.bashrc. It is recommended for developers who may change the codes. The changes will be immediately reflected once you pulled the code and rebuild the project (no need to call setup again)
```
export PYTHONPATH=~/xgboost/python-package
